In the earliest moments of Western philosophy, Socrates distinguished himself by asking, \"How should one live?\" Increasingly, however, that question and its variants have taken a back seat in philosophy, abandoned to the best-seller lists and to publications produced by recent graduates of assertiveness training workshops. We reclaim these questions and take them up again from within the discipline of philosophy itself.

>PHIL>|> 110A>|>The Good Life or How Should One Live?>|>Much recent philosophy in the English-speaking world has focused on the nature of things and our knowledge and reasoning about such things. But most human mental activity is not theoretical, but practical; less concerned with how the world is than with what is to be done. In the earliest moments of Western philosophy, Socrates distinguished himself by asking, \"How should one live?\" Increasingly, however, that question and its variants have taken a back seat in philosophy, abandoned to the best-seller lists and to publications produced by recent graduates of assertiveness training workshops. We reclaim these questions and take them up again from within the discipline of philosophy itself. Questions asked include: \"How should I live?\" \"What are the good things in life?\" \"Does life have meaning?\" Readings include Darwin, Nietzsche, Freud, Murdoch, Dennett, Dawkins, Hacking, Nozick, and Nagel. Usually offered every third year.\nMr. Teuber>|>WI>

>RPJM>|> 101>|>Foundations of Project Management>|>This course will provide the student with an understanding of the history, current practice, and future directions of project management. Principles and concepts of project management will be presented and discussed within the context of the knowledge areas and process groups defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).\n\nPrerequisites \nStudents do not need to have any previous project management experience.\nStudents with experience will also benefit from the materials presented and the in-class discussions; they will develop a deeper understanding of the project management profession and more effective project management techniques. No preliminary knowledge of a scheduling tool such as MS-Project is required.\n\nOverview and Approach\nPick up almost any business magazine from the last five years and 9 times out of 10 there will be an article in it relating the story of a failed project. While numerous factors contribute to these failures, many of them are attributable to ineffective project management. In reaction to this history of failures, project management has become recognized as a discipline to be studied and learned, not just something you do when you are not doing your real job. Also during this period the Project Management\nInstitute created and published their Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), which has been adapted as an ANSI Standard. Membership in the Project Management Institute (PMI) has grown from 8,000 in 1991 to over 200,000 today.\n\nThrough text readings, online lecture readings, discussions, assignments, and use of case studies, the student will become familiar with project management theory and techniques and learn how to apply them to real projects.  \n\nUnlike training courses, offering project management at the graduate level allows a more in depth exploration of the theory, context, and techniques upon which project management is based.  Successful completion of this course will prepare students for further study in the Masters Degree program.\n\n\nTopics covered: \nProject Initiation\nPlanning\nTracking & Reporting\nMonitoring & Control\nProject Closure\nRisk Management\nQuality Management\nResource Management\nCommunications Management\nEstimating Techniques\nEarned Value Analysis\nAdaptive Project Framework\neXtreme Project Management\nProject Office Implementations\n\nStudents registered for current offerings of this course can find a list of book requirements at the Brandeis University Bookstore or online at http:// brandeis.bkstore.com.\n\nMicrosoft Project (version 2000 or higher) is required for this class.

>RSEG>|> 108>|>Advanced C Programming for Unix/Linux>|>Knowledge of C, and of the UNIX API, is important for students pursuing study in Software Engineering. Modern languages such as Java have been especially designed to avoid features of C that are considered to be \"dangerous in the wrong hands\", such as pointers and low-level bit manipulations. Students who have never worked with C cannot fully appreciate these design decisions.\n\nMany algorithms are expressed as C functions, and a knowledge of  C helps to read and understand them. Dynamic languages such as Perl are written in C. Students who know C programming have an advantage when using and extending Perl compared to students who do not know it.\n\nStudents who expect to develop applications for UNIX-like platforms need exposure to the Single UNIX Specification and the IEEE POSIX (Portable Operating System) standard. This knowledge transfers directly to other \"POSIX-compliant\" operating systems such as Windows and OS/390. Students who intend to develop embedded, hard-real-time applications for data acquisition, motor control, and robotics need to know C in order to gain the performance and control capabilities that only this language provides.\n        \nThis course is intended to provide an accelerated survey of C programming, with an eye to providing students with the knowledge they need to explore and practice using the SUS/POSIX system interfaces for programming on UNIX/Linux systems. The course will then build on this foundation to explore techniques for application of the UNIX system interfaces.\n\nStudents registered for current offerings of this course can find a list of book requirements at the Brandeis University Bookstore or online at http:// brandeis.bkstore.com.>|>>

On the client side, we learn how to create attractive and well-functioning web pages using XHTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. The server side web development focuses on web development with servlets JavaServerPages (JSP), Struts, JavaServerFaces (JSF).  Web applications, built with these technologies, access and interact with databases using Java Data Base Connectivity (JDBC).\nAdditional Description \nThis course presents an in-depth analysis of the following topics of Web Development Technologies:\n¿	Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML)  has replaced HTML as a primary markup language fro developing client side web pages. This topic examines the use of Basic Tags, Links, Colors, Images, Objects, Tables, Forms, Frames.\n¿	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) control the style of your web pages, including the colors and size of fonts, the width and colors of lines, and the amount of whitespace between items on the page. This topic examines the use of Fonts, Text, Selectors, Lengths, Box Model, Links, Lists, Tables.\n¿	JavaScript provides dynamic content to web pages and is used as a main client side scripting language for Web applications development. This topic examines the use of JavaScript¿s Control Structures, Functions, Arrays, Objects, Events, Form Validation and Enhancements.\n\n¿	Web Applications Development with Ant.   Another Neat Tool (Ant) enables you to automate the build and deploy process of your Web application.  This topic examines the build and deploy process of a sample Web application using Tomcat Web server.\n\n¿	Web Applications Development with Servlets allows a two-way interaction between a client and a web server. Servlets generates a web page for each client request that may be crucial when a page is changed dynamically based on the data changed by users or databases.\nThis topic examines how servlets can be used to develop Web applications with these features. This topic also examines the process of connection to a database, using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).\n\n\n¿	Web Applications Development with JavaServer Pages (JSP) simplifies and accelerates the process of creating dynamic Web applications. JSP accomplishes this task by separating the presentation of content (e.g. XHTML pages) from the implementation that generates the content (e.g. servlets).\n\nThis topic examines how JSP can be used to develop Web applications quickly and easily using the standard XHTML along with some new markup tags that add dynamic content to a Web page.\n\n¿	Web Applications Development with Struts examines the use of a widely used web presentation technology to build web applications. All three parts of Model-View-Controller architecture that is in the core\nof Struts based Web applications are examined. This topic also examines the process of Struts applications cconnection to a database, using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).\n\n¿	Web Applications Development with JavaServer Faces (JSF) examines the use of another widely used web presentation technology to build web applications. This topic examines core parts of JSF:  Managed Beans, Navigation, Standard JSF Tags, Data Tables, Conversion and Validation, Event Handling. \n        This topic also examines the process of JSF applications connection to a database, using Java\n         Database Connectivity  (JDBC).\n\no	Web Applications Development with Ajax examines the use of the Ajax technology that provides asynchronous processing of request that eliminates the need to change the whole web page if a small part of page is changed. The topic examines how Ajax provides for richness and responsiveness that Web applications could not achieve before.>|>>

>RVTM>|> 115>|>Collaboration and Communication Technology in Virtual Environments>|>Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n\nDetermine the set of communication tools are needed for a particular virtual team based on team and project needs\n\nSelect and use interpersonal and group communication tools to provide direct as well as asynchronous communications between team members\n\nSelect, and use collaboration suites to enhance and enable team collaboration efforts\n\nApply information sharing, broadcasting, and gathering techniques to provide successful information exchange between team members\n\nUse knowledge resource tools to set up team knowledge bases and to perform knowledge research\n\nUnderstand and apply security provisions for team communication and knowledge sharing\n\nCourse Description\nVirtual and global teams need collaboration and communication tools and technology in order to participate together in projects and team meetings, to perform their daily work, and to share and store information. We will review and access a number of collaboration and communication tools that virtual teams can use to communicate person-to-person and as a group. We will understand the principles that make e-collaboration successful. Students will learn about collaboration suites and knowledge resource tools. Information sharing, information broadcasting and information gathering techniques will also be discussed. Students will have hands-on experiences with many of the communication tools discussed in class, and will form virtual teams for projects in order to research and practice various collaboration and communication tools.\n\nPrerequisites: RVTM 101: Foundations of Virtual Team Management and Communication, or RPJM 114: Managing Projects across Cultures and Geographies, or permission of the instructor.\n\nOverview \nVirtual and global teams cannot communicate using the same techniques as teams where all members are located in the same office. Face-to-face meetings are possible but limited, and informal face-to-face communication and management approaches do not apply to distributed teams. Time zones and language differences cause additional challenges for teams with members in different locations throughout the world. This course will focus on collaboration and communication tools and technology available to virtual teams. These tools provide immediate communication and exchange of information that replaces or supplements the traditional communication methods used by teams that are located in the same office. We will understand the principles that allow virtual teams to engage successfully in e-collaboration. We will review and access tools that allow team members to communicate with each directly, such as instant messaging, chats, web meetings, video and phone conferencing. We will also review the tools that allow delayed communication where the members do not have to be all present at the same time, such as email, discussion boards, blogs, and team web sites. Effective tools for broadcasting information, such as webcasts, podcasts, and news feeds, will also be discussed. \n\nCourse Approach\nReadings, discussions, and team and individual projects will be used to convey the main body of knowledge and practice the communications tools and technology discussed in the class. The course projects will involve forming virtual teams and using the communication tools discussed in class for team collaboration and team projects. Team communication, collaborative work, and presentation of the projects will be done using the communication tools discussed in class. The projects will focus on understanding and applying the various communication technologies, researching the various technologies and tools available to virtual teams, and understanding the advantages and drawbacks of each type of tool.>|>>
>RVTM>|> 120>|>Organizational Systems and Communications>|>This course explores the roles of individuals and teams within organizations and the skills and techniques required to manage successfully in the diversified organizations of the 21st century. Social networks and virtual teams are replacing committee meetings. Values and self-leadership are replacing command and control management. Diversity and globalization have become challenges as well as competitive opportunities for organizations.

>USEM>|>   8B>|>Freedom of Will, Responsibility, and Blame>|>Are we free or is freedom just a convenient illusion? Is free action compatible with a material world that seems to follow deterministic laws? What does it mean to hold somebody responsible? What are we doing when we praise or blame people for their actions? Readings include historical and contemporary philosophical writings, and students will have an opportunity to apply some of their knowledge to an analysis of free will as it appears in film or literature. \nMs. Moran (Philosophy)>|>USEM>

>USEM>|>  18A>|>Understanding Evil and Human Destiny>|>Designed to introduce students to some of the Western classics that deal with the impact of evil on human destiny. Suffering, justice, and death are studied in their relationship with God, the world, and history.\nMr. Kimelman (Near Eastern and Judaic Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  19A>|>Dangerous Beauty>|>What is the relationship of the beautiful to the good? Is our culture's preoccupation with physical beauty--in movies, television, magazines--a principal source of  its dilemmas? Or is beauty itself a moral force rather than the handmaiden of sex and violence? These and related questions are pursued in this seminar, using as the principal text the recent study by Elaine Scarry, On Beauty and Being Just, in which she argues that the beautiful should be enlisted as a powerful ally in the fight for justice.\nMr. Yourgrau (Philosophy)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  20A>|>From Colonies to Independent States: Decolonization in Comparative Perspective>|>Open only to first-year students in the Lerman Neubauer scholars program.\n\nThe middle of the twentieth century was a time of political, social, and economic upheaval globally. Colonies of European powers embarked on the path to independence, struggling to define new identities. Struggles over power, identity, race, and class characterize the decolonization experience of developing countries. The decolonization experience using (primarily) literature and political writings is examined. The experience of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean are covered. Texts include Frantz Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth; Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism; George Orwell, Burmese Days; Jamaica Kincaid, A Small Place; Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness; V.S. Naipaul, A Bend in the River; Adam Hochschild, King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa. \nMs. Thorne (Politics)>|>USEM>

>USEM>|>  24B>|>The Howl of Simple Words: Reading Gender in Israeli Literature and Cinema>|>The poet Rachel Bluwstein describes her poetics as \"the howl of simple words.\" With these words she exposes the normative expectation of women's writing at the beginning of the century, on the one hand, and the subversive potential that lies in women's creativity, on the other. This seminar explores this ongoing duality in Modern Hebrew literature and Israeli cinema.\nMs. Szobel (Near Eastern and Judaic Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  25A>|>The Artist Behind their Work>|>No previous painting or drawing experience required.\n\nStudents will gain a deeper appreciation for the artist's approach, style, and content through the execution/replication of a chosen artist's work, along with extensive research defining the artist's life, including the political, social, and economic effects that inspired his/her work. \nMr. Moody (Theater Arts)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  26B>|>Maps of Hidden Worlds: From the Cosmos to the Human Genome>|>Explores the science behind making maps of worlds that we cannot perceive with our senses. In particular, this seminar examines maps of the universe around us and maps of the cells within us. The approach is historical, covering the great discoveries that have culminated in the mapping of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the sequencing of the human genome. Some of the questions considered are: How does one measure the distance to a galaxy far, far away? How do we know the age of the universe? What does it mean to sequence the human genome? What is nature's nanotechnology and how do we discover it?\nMr. Kondev (Physics)>|>USEM>

>USEM>|>  39A>|>On the Road from Homer to Ridley Scott>|>The voyage has always played an important role in European and American literature and culture. Analyzes the theme of the voyage as it occurs in written works and in films, pondering questions about why the trip is made and what the \"road\" in the trip means. Why, for example, does Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey embark on his trip? Or why do the title characters in Ridley Scott's film Thelma and Louise set off on theirs?\nMr. Randall (Romance Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  39B>|>Human Rights in Literature, Film and Performance>|>Artistic languages have been important tools for bearing witness to human rights abuses and can serve as symbolic tribunals for processing particular cases, leading to a new arena for asking fundamental philosophical and political questions concerning the discourse human rights. We will look at fiction, testimonials, theater and film, dealing with problems that are intrinsic to the definition and implementation of human rights: How is \"human\" defined in relation to the possession of rights? How is \"universal\" drawn and what does it exclude? We will pay particular attention to Latin American cultural production, but without excluding other regions.\nMr. Rosenberg (Romance Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  40B>|>What a Good Idea! Technology and Innovation in Society>|>Open only to first-year students in the Lerman Neubauer scholars program.\n\nExplores the historical, economic and social context of the process of innovation, beginning in pre-modern times but with emphasis on the science-based innovation system that arose during the nineteenth century.\nMr. Jaffe (Economics)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  41A>|>Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\">|>This class focuses on one of the centrally important texts in modern Western science: Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. The publication of the Origin completely transformed Western society, providing a new paradigm that ranks in its far-reaching effects with those of Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton. Although Darwin's work is often cited, frequently celebrated, and sometimes maligned, it is seldom read. This course provides students the opportunity to read and study the Origin in its entirety. We focus closely on the text itself, paying particular attention to Darwin's ideas and the structure of his arguments. Along the way, we consider the strengths and weaknesses of these arguments, his use of evidence, and the historical and philosophical context of his ideas.\nMr. Morris (Biology)>|>OC>

>USEM>|>  42B>|>China in the Western Imagination>|>An exploration of the many meanings of China to Western observers from Marco Polo to the present day. Materials include writing by philosophers and missionaries, diplomats and travelers, journalists, poets and fiction writers, each of whom found China--whether by means of investigation or purely by imagination--a civilization that stood as the antithesis of the one from which they came. The class seeks to understand not only what these writers had to say about China itself, but also (and perhaps more importantly) how they used the contrasting example of China to critique or otherwise illuminate the European or American culture in which they themselves lived.\nMr. Platt (History)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  43A>|>Get the Hero>|>War hero, superhero, my hero, anti-hero; these are just a few varieties of \"hero\" that exist in our language and culture.  This course seeks to defamiliarize what this word means in our world, looking instead to its ancient origins.  Focusing on Greece, where the term was invented, as well as Rome, Mesopotamia, the Middle East, and India, students will discover the shared notions of \"hero\" as well as key distinctions within each respective cultural context. This course will read, discuss, and write about epics, comedies, tragedies, Plato, and parts of the New Testament.  Mr. Muellner (Classical Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  46B>|>Cities and Cyberspace>|>How are cities and cyberspace related? How do anonymity and transiency, characteristics common to both, shape social identity and social relationships? These questions are addressed in an exploration of urbanism and the worlds of computer-mediated communication.\nMr. Jacobson (Anthropology)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  46C>|>Life Science Research: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow>|>Open only to first-year students in the life science scholars program. \n\nA year-long course which acquaints students with cutting-edge researchers from the Brandeis community and their research techniques in the life sciences.\nMr. Rosbash (Biology)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  47B>|>Growing Up Male: The Boy Culture>|>Men are made, not born. A male baby identifies with his mother. How is the male identity created? Using primarily movies, but also short stories, poems, and plays, this course explores the twisting and turning road to manhood with insights from psychology, sociology, and anthropology.\nMr. Holmberg (Theater Arts)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  48B>|>The Rational and Irrational>|>Rationality has often been viewed as humanity's most distinctive and prized possession. Reason is said to elevate us above other living things and to make human existence especially valuable. Critics and detractors, however, have held that there is at bottom a core of irrationality that is indispensable to the meaning of our lives. Explores the scope and limits of human reason from the perspectives of philosophy, psychology, and literature.\nMr. Hirsch (Philosophy)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  51A>|>Trauma and Memory in the Literary Imagination>|>Examines the work of writers who have borne witness to traumatic events from war and genocide to family violence and interracial conflict. In addition to first-person accounts that narrate extreme experience, readings include critical studies in the meaning of trauma and its representations. Studies the ways trauma is figured in Holocaust literature, memoirs about the family, a novel about the legacy of slavery, and in individually chosen texts. The study ends with a unit on witnessing today's traumas, from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina, and the role of visual documents in the process of bearing witness to extreme experiences.\nMs. Skorczewski (English and American Literature)>|>USEM>

Will study how the interaction of the three faiths helped produce a unique culture.\nMr. Decter (Near Eastern and Judaic Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  54A>|>Ideas of Equality, Systems of Inequality>|>Examines classic and contemporary accounts of equality and inequality in Western and non-Western societies. We first read influential philosophical texts on human equality and inequality and then confront these speculative accounts with empirical and cross-cultural evidence from \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical\" societies. In subsequent units we read several historical, sociological, and autobiographical texts that enable us to compare systems of inequality based on various combinations of dimensions such as gender, ethnicity, rank, and class. The origins of an ideology of individual equality in the Western tradition and ways that obvious evidence of inequality is \"naturalized\" and \"rationalized\" in contemporary American culture are examined.\nMr. Parmentier (Anthropology)>|>USEM>

>USEM>|>  57B>|>Why Work?>|>Mankind has always \"worked,\" but the tasks and their material and social significance have evolved, and this evolution is accelerating. Considers how societies in different times and places view work, how different societies parcel out the tasks that individuals perform, how technology and specialization interact, and how work is related to experience beyond the workplace. Why do members of affluent societies work as long and as hard as we do?\nMs. Carter (Economics)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  64A>|>True Crime and American Culture>|>This seminar explores a series of enduringly fascinating cases from the true-crime files of American culture. Our crime-scene investigations will range from 1692 Salem to 1994 Brentwood; our lineup will include witches, outlaws, kidnappers, gangsters, murderers, and serial killers; and our evidence will be drawn from literature, film, and television.\nMr. Doherty (American Studies)>|>USEM>

All readings are in English.\nMr. Fraleigh (German, Russian, and Asian Languages and Literature)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  67A>|>Politics as Seen through Fiction>|>How modern fiction helps us understand the dilemmas of politics, the tensions between ideas and actions, social change, leaders and followers, societies in transition and decay, revolution, law, bureaucracy, and ethnicity. Koestler, Twain, Sartre, Oz, Solzhenitsyn, Kafka, and Greene are read. Format is a highly interactive seminar with several short writing assignments.\nMr. Levin (Politics)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  67B>|>Public Intellectuals in American Life>|>This course examines the role and influence of public intellectuals in American society. The primary focus is on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although students explore the work of some of America's first \"homegrown\" public intellectuals in the nineteenth century as well.  Students are asked to consider what constitutes an \"intellectual\" body of work, and how and why that work might be rendered relevant to a mass audience.  They explore the ideas put forth by some of the most influential public intellectuals in American life, and they are challenged to consider the impact the modern university has had on public intellectualism.  \nMs. Farrelly (American Studies)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  68B>|>The Art of Living>|>How ought I to live my life?

>USEM>|>  69A>|>Human Movement and the Sense of Self>|>The capacity to move reflects and governs self-identity. How would being unable to move affect your experiences and others' experience of you? What can be learned about human adaptability and volition from movement problems in space flight or from robotic prostheses interfaced to the human brain? Is \"The Matrix\" possible? These questions are analyzed through discussion of laboratory demonstrations and texts in neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.\nMr. DiZio (Psychology)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  73A>|>Thinking about Infinity>|>Explores the attempts of the finite human mind to think about infinity. Readings in mathematics, history of science, philosophy, literature, and art, including Euclid, Plato, Cantor, Poincaré, Einstein, Pascal, Kant, Hegel, Wordsworth, Shelley, Joyce, Beckett, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael.\nMr. Flesch (English and American Literature)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  77A>|>Where the Idea of the Computer Came From>|>Where did the idea of the computer come from? Examines its cultural, nonengineering roots in philosophy, logic, and mathematics: algorithms, undecidability, games, mechanical intelligence and the mind, and precursor ideas of desktop publishing and Internet technology. Readings include historical documents as well as fiction. A willingness to think abstractly and mathematically is an informal prerequisite.\nMr. Mairson (Computer Science)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  83B>|>Science in Art>|>How do we know whether that painting or that sculpture is \"genuine\"? Usually, it's because we take the word of the museum or the art dealer. But many works of art are discredited every day as new methods are applied to determine the \"fine structure\" of a particular artifact. Art objects are looked at critically, from the point of view of the conservator, who has to determine a piece's value before it is bought or displayed.\nMs. Ringe (Chemistry/Biochemistry)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  84A>|>Fin de Millenium>|>In contrast to le fin de siecle signaling a promising new direction in art and literature in the Western world, le fin de millenium created a sense of foreboding about the future of our civil society. In the span of the hundred years that mark the end of the millennium the West has traveled from Freud's look back on our Hellenic heritage of the unconscious mind in the form of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex to the literary critic Geoffrey Hartman's reflection on 9/11. In between we'll stop at the literary and artistic milestones of Thomas Mann, Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, Kingsley Amis, Saul Bellow, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Philip Roth, John Updike, and Art Spiegelman. Could we have had any idea that the twenty-first century and the new millennium would begin with a struggle against world-wide terrorism that embraces the ideology of Jihadism?\nMr. Greenberg (Philosophy)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  86A>|>The Face in the Mirror: Drawing Out the Self>|>This course will take an in-depth look into self-portraiture studied through a series of drawings and paintings on paper using drawing materials and water-soluble paints, exploring  various avenues of the practice throughout the duration of the course.  Discussions will focus on studio practice as well as historical through contemporary artists' approaches to the subject, which will help students utilize these strategies in their work to help express themselves.\nMr. Wardwell (Fine Arts)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  87B>|>Seeking Justice: Jews and Germans>|>The relationship between Jews and Germans is defined by the most horrific crime against humanity, the Holocaust. How could a modern civilized nation like Germany perpetrate the Nazi crimes? What led to Hitler's success and how have Jews and Germans overcome a history of injustice since 1945? \nMs. von Mering (German, Russian, and Asian Languages and Literature)>|>USEM>
>USEM>|>  88A>|>Confessions and Meditations>|>Studies four great works of self-reflection and self-examination: Augustine's Confessions, Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Rousseau's Confessions, and Thoreau's Walden. Considers such questions as: What has spurred the writers on to self-examination? Why do they write? What do they defend, and what do they question, in their own lives? What solutions do they propose? How do they think they (and perhaps we, too) should live?\nMs. Quinney (English and American Literature)>|>USEM>

We will explore how the interfaces between literature and medical knowledge can strengthen and support both the doctor-physician relationship and a physician's instincts overall. We will examine medical literature from a sociological dimension.  We will look at medicine through the lenses of Social Darwinism, Immigrant culture clash, and Feminism.  \nMr. Wirth>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>   2A>|>Murder Most Foul>|>As the story of Cain and Abel in the Book of Genesis demonstrates, the taking of a human life by another human being is considered a terrible crime, and subject to severe punishment. What, however, defines a murderer? In common law jurisdictions, murder is both the act of killing a person, as well as the state of mind that makes it a purposeful act. It is usually supposed that both these actions exist in the person of the murderer. However, what if the hand that strikes the killing blow is not the psyche that conceives of the crime? The concept of the instigator of malevolence figures significantly in classical and modern literature.\n\nYou will be reading Shakespeare's Othello in order to compare Iago's role with Othello's in bringing about the murder of Desdemona. In interrogating the moral, social and often ironic elements of murder, we will be aided by Foucault's groundbreaking idea of social surveillance and behavior in `Panopticism' as we consider the key characters in Hitchcock's Rope in the context of the instigation of murder, murder as an art form and the role of the school as a social institution. We will also read selectively among Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue, Arthur Conan Doyle's The Speckled Band, Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express and Curtain: Poirot's Last Case and set these texts against well-known treatises on murder to analyze different ways in which murder can be both committed and interpreted by society.\nMs. Murugesan>|>UWS>

How have urban segregation and such techniques as surveillance and torture become normalized in governing societies? In general, how can we understand the complex interdependence between state and violence in the everyday life? We will read the works of Foucault and Orwell as well as discuss feature newspaper articles, ethnographic film, song lyrics and memoirs of a former political prisoner to explore how the state is related to violence both at home and abroad. In the final research paper you will investigate an event or a process of your own choice, analyzing the relationship between the state and violence as one of its tools of power.\nMs. Jusionyte>|>UWS>

On the one hand, it often points to the profound truth of individual and cultural identity. We use it to describe the uniqueness of authors and artists. We use it to validate the authenticity of political advocates. On the other hand, it can also point to the irrational or inexplicable. The voice of God and the voices in our heads are counterparts to the logic of everyday decision-making. Including text by Charles Brockton Brown, Herman Melville and Kathy Acker, this course will examine disparate representations of voice in the American tradition and compile a glossary of the metaphor¿s meanings.\nMr. Van Kley>|>UWS>

This course teaches the secrets of successful writing. Its reading list contains no complex theoretical literature, only short essays by great writers: Montaigne, Bacon, Tolstoy, Huxley, Brookner, Benjamin, Ozick.  You'll write three essays: a short technical analysis of Aldous Huxley's The Charms of History and the Future of the Past; a comparative reading between two essays (the Second Epilogue to Tolstoy's War and Peace and Isaiah Berlin's The Hedgehog and the Fox); and then a research essay on a topic of your choice.\nMr. Green>|>UWS>

The body intersects with: the practice of medicine, through screening techniques and biomedical interventions; body modification, including cosmetic surgery and weight management; and, state policies regarding reproduction and sexual behavior. In this course, we develop an analytical understanding of the body and its cultural meanings, and we interrogate body practices in terms of discourses of gender and power. \nMs. Waggoner>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>   6A>|>Modernism Through Music>|>In the twentieth century, music along with literature, art, and poetry continued a march along an evolutionary path that coincided directly with disciplines of the sciences and thought that affected, and were affected by the everyday life of people the world over. Impressionism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, and Neo-classicism, for example, are just a few of the trends that coalesced to form the artistic timbre of the twenty-first century. Students will be encouraged to examine any one of the twentieth-century artistic movement they choose through music, comparing it to any one of its artistic counterparts such as painting. In the process, students will seek to answer two questions: 1. How are the characteristics of the given trend chosen by the student manifested in music and its counterpart and 2. What characteristics does the trend in question have that differ between music and its counterpart. This class does require some prior knowledge of music or another artistic discipline.\nMr. Eschler>|>UWS>

These commentators point to the multiplicity of satiric forms that have emerged with the new century and the ease with which they find new targets and audiences. This course offers the opportunity to investigate the mode of expression we call satire through a variety of readings in multiple media that stretch from satire's modern reinvention in the early Eighteenth Century to the present day. Students will investigate a number of different theories of satire that attempt to define the genre in various ways. \nMr. Plunkett>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>   7B>|>Incidents of Travel>|>Travel literature comes in many forms: the adventure novel, the documentary film, and even ethnography. These texts attempt, often successfully, to transport the spectator. Intended to present a snapshot of an `exotic¿ landscape or culture, such texts afford the opportunity to examine an author¿s cultural biases, as well as those of the intended audience.  How, for instance, might such narratives problematically other their subjects? Whose perspective do such accounts privilege? What might get lost in the one-sided representation?\nTexts include selections from Samuel Johnson¿s Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1785), John L. Stephens¿s Incidents of Travel in Yucatan (1843), and Robert J. Flaherty¿s film Nanook of the North (1922).  Students will also examine a more contemporary travel narrative of their choosing for their final assignment.\nMs. John>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>   8A>|>Music and Noise>|>What is music? For that matter, what is noise? Do these terms, music and noise, have an objective definition? To some music exists only in Heavy Metal, Easy Listening, or Classical, while to others music exists solely in nature, devoid of any human production whatsoever. Still, others consider everything music: silence, the sounds of a construction site, the squeaking of a rubber duck. During the twentieth-century several artists forced people to think deeper about what defines music by introducing non-conventional instruments, highly complex structures, multitudes of unresolved dissonances, and new artistic concepts into their art. On a somewhat different note, some claim the music industry has turned music less into an art and more into a product, a commodity devoid of artistic meaning. Since these radical shifts in artistic thinking and the industrialization of music the phrase \"one person's music is another person's noise\" has evolved into a far more complex statement with significantly more interpretations than in previous centuries.\nThrough critical reading, writing, and peer review we will take a look at artists whose work straddles the line between art, music, and noise. Our writing will primarily concern the issues of music as torture, \"Anti-Art\", and the saturation of our environment with sound and music.\nMr. Spindler>|>UWS>

More than forty years after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law, stakeholders continue to grapple with how to best reform the nation¿s schools.  For example, in 2002, President George W. Bush signed the bi-partisan No Child Left Behind Act, which mandated increased student standardized testing, and imposed sanctions on schools and school districts that failed to meet adequate yearly progress.  In this writing seminar, students will have the opportunity to learn about education reform through a variety of perspectives, sources, and approaches. \nMs. Prosky>|>UWS>

But is this the whole story? What role did Indians play in the history of the United States? Is Native American history purely a story of conquest? Did Indians have no say over the course of their own destinies? In this writing seminar we examine the history of the mid-to-late nineteenth century West through the eyes of Native Americans, asking how Indian peoples understood and dealt with the transforming world around them.\nMr. Cracraft>|>UWS>

What is the inherent theatricality of madness, as well as the madness of theatricality? From Medea to Hamlet to Blanche DuBois, the madman and madwoman have been recurrent dramatic archetypes, figures that both critique social conventions and complicate the notion of a stable, unified self. \n\nWe will examine theatrical representations of insanity, focusing on major works by modern dramatists. The texts we examine will include Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, Peter Shaffer's Equus, and David Auburn's Proof. We will discuss the manner in which madness is linked to creativity, sexuality, and the desire for transcendence.\nMs. Nelson>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  11A>|>Shakespeare and the Samurai>|>Although adaptations of Shakespeare continually surprise us with the play's adaptability to the silver screen, what is most fascinating is the means in which non-English cultures have been drawn to the project of adapting his tragedies into film.\nIn the case of Kurosawa's films Ran and Throne of Blood, the \"new\" setting takes place in feudal Japan. Replacing broadswords with katanas is one thing; more significantly, Kurosawa replaces Shakespeare's dialogue as well, prompting the question: is this a form of adaptation? Or translation?\nThis course will pair one or two well-known plays by Shakespeare with two well-known films by Akira Kurosawa¿ including but not limited to Ran and Throne of Blood (both of which were adapted from Shakespeare's King Lear and Macbeth, respectively). Using aspects of film theory we will analyze these pieces in terms of style, cinematography, and performance, pursuing questions of how Kurosawa adapts and/or transforms Early Modern concepts of honor, allegiance, and courtly behavior.\nMs. Austin>|>UWS>

Turned on the central character and the tragedy as a whole, it has generated a flood of responses that shows no signs of abating. In this University Writing Seminar, we will conduct an intense, semester-long reading of Hamlet, and we will explore a wide variety of related materials, ranging from historical sources and critical commentary on the play to modern reactions to it. The goal of this seminar is to arrive at a better understanding of Hamlet as a text that is simultaneously determined by the historical moment out of which it arose, and that has, time and again, prompted audiences and readers to find reflections of themselves in it.\nMr. Moraw>|>UWS>

Is it a human need to create elaborate explanations in order to legitimize why and how we exist today?  In this writing seminar, we will explore the ways in which peoples through time have tried to conceptualize of the foundations of their culture or society and have subsequently depicted them in artwork.\nMs. Kingsley>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  13B>|>Mediating the \"Other\":  Representation and Interpretation>|>Media inspires an abundance of responses from pundits, parents, and policy-makers, responses ranging from utopian visions of a better future to dystopian expectations of destroyed tradition. Media is often considered to have the ability to directly affect behavior, while simultaneously viewed as ¿just¿ media, and therefore unreal. But the ethnographic study of media has revealed that processes of representation and interpretation are far more complex than that. On the one hand, representations of the ¿other¿ in American media can reveal important tropes of inclusion and exclusion, and can subtly reflect relations of exploitation and domination. On the other hand, cross-cultural studies show that different cultures often interpret the same programming differently.\n This seminar will examine representations of the ¿other¿ in American media, and consider how American media is understood cross-culturally.\nMs. Jaysane-Darr>|>UWS>

It sparked not only American colonization, but also ignited the explosive growth of African slavery, European imperialism, and global capitalism. But as important as this phenomenon is, its dynamics are still not fully understood. Various paradigms have been suggested to explain this encounter: contact, conquest, colonization, adaptation, and resistance. Each of these models reflects a particular moral and political point of view, but no singular experience captures the diverse and pluralistic experience of New World encounters.\n\nIn this course, students will read the writings of Spanish conquistadores, Aztec nobles, and French missionaries, comparing the interpretations of encounters across a range of space, time, and cultures. Then students will conduct their own firsthand research into early encounters in the Boston area, learning how a broader understanding of the process of encounter changes their perspective.\nMr. DeCoster>|>UWS>

For Shelley, Frankensteins monster proposes the question:  if a creature is ¿manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth, does it count as being truly alive?  Does it count as having a soul?  Shelleys question about the nature of life itself, the soul, and their relationship to science has fascinated writers all through the nineteenth century to the present day.  We examine the interplay and collisions between spiritual and scientific explanations of the soul, consciousness, and life itself in nineteenth and twentieth-century literature, science, and popular culture. \nMs. Schroeder>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  15A>|>Friendship, Justice, and Politics>|>According to Aristotle, \"If people are friends, they have no need of justice.\" Yet, we are all familiar with stories of loyalty, love, and friendship getting in the way of the pursuit of justice, whether it is the code of honor among thieves, helping a friend evade the law, or refusing to testify against a loved one. What is a little injustice among friends? Are friends beyond justice? Does friendship impede the pursuit of justice? Is friendship itself a higher form of justice? In other words: can it be unjust to be a good friend?\n\nThis course explores the tensions between friendship and justice in the great works of moral or political philosophy and literature. We begin with a study of how philosophers such as Aristotle, Montaigne, and Nietzsche treated the problems of friendship and justice. Next, we investigate how these philosophic concepts play out in literature, specifically the work of Graham Greene. Finally, we confront the ways that the potential tensions between justice and friendship play out in politics.\nMr. McCarty>|>UWS>

Why has this rebellious trend become so influential? How has Minimalism been the creative conduit for many politically driven composers? Through the analysis of Minimalist concert music, film music, and opera, as well as various texts on musical aesthetics, we will discover how this artistic philosophy has formed the identity of an entire generation of American musicians and artists.  Subject matter for writing assignments will discuss the music and artistic statements of composers such as John Adams, Phillip Glass, Steve Reich, David Lang, Terry Riley, as well as other musicians, bands, artists, architects, and writers who have been influenced by the Minimalist movement.  Prior formal knowledge of music is not a requirement for this course.\nMr. Lane>|>UWS>

Why, at the turn of the twentieth century, did authors begin producing works that were radical in form, yet whose content was often organized by ancient myths or religious systems? Does ¿high modernism¿ define the peak of modernity, or does it include an implicit critique of modern culture and intellectual life? And to what extent do these concerns still govern debates today, in our ¿post¿-modern society. To explore these ideas, this course will pair theoretical texts by authors such as Nietzsche, Benjamin, Eliot, and Kierkegaard, with the writings of the poets W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and Hart Crane, the novelists James Joyce and Djuna Barnes, and the playwrights Henrick Ibsen and Samuel Beckett.\nMr. Rutledge>|>UWS>

Is it even reasonable to raise such questions, or is there something incoherent about their very nature?  Quite often, attempts to address these fundamental human concerns have taken literary form, finding expression in stories, dialogues, parables, and poetry.  This course will pair theoretical texts by authors such as Nietzsche, Dennett, Nagel, and Blond with literary works that take up existential themes, such as Plato¿s Meno, Camus¿s The Stranger, short stories by Flannery O¿Connor, the soliloquies of Hamlet, The Book of Job, Ecclesiastes, Wildes The Picture of Dorian Gray, Kierkegaard¿s Fear and Trembling, and selections from Romantic and Modernist poetry.\nMr. Rutledge>|>UWS>

Comparing Calcutta and Chicago, he deplored the avarice, the dirt, and the savagery of the latter while clarifying that the city was not, he thought, a good representative of the rest of the country. Still, unlike either Salt Lake or San Francisco, it was, Kipling wrote, the first real city he had encountered in America. Five decades later, Richard Hofstadter--the 1956 Pulitzer Prize winner for history--argued that the United States \"was born in the country and ha[d] moved to the city.\" Though \"the land of the free and the home of the brave\" first became an urban state in the 1910s, the city had long been a place of great significance--a center of commerce, culture, and politics. But just what was \"the city in the wilderness,\" before the age of the skyscraper and the streetcar? What distinguished it from the country? How did it look? Who peopled it? How did it operate? And what happens when the birth of a nation, this nation, is set in the cities?\nThis course will traverse the alleys and the thoroughfares of the big towns of early America, from prehistoric times to the middle of the nineteenth century.\nMr. Doyle>|>UWS>

Established to repress noncompliant thinking inside the church, and deviant social behaviors, it developed into different local Inquisitions. There is in fact, not one Inquisition; there are many.

In this course, we will consider some of the following questions: How do we categorize literature that contains these themes? Does their presence create, as some theorists of the Gothic believe, a site for literary transgression and the expression of otherness? In what ways do these works intersect with issues of sex, race, class and gender? We will consider three writers' works in some depth. Beginning with William Beckford¿s Gothic novel Vathek, we will then skip forward in time to the work of H. P. Lovecraft. From there, we will again jump forward to a writer of the modern Gothic, Stephenie Meyer. Our discussions will also by supplemented by short selections from other writers as well as by critical readings.\nMr. Donatacci>|>UWS>

Should websites such as YouTube have the right to keep enormous profits generated from the free material uploaded by its users?  Should we prosecute illegal downloads and can the illegal downloading of music even be regulated? What is ultimately the effect on music as an industry and on music as an art form, and with endlessly changing technology, what¿s in store for the future? This course will take a hard look at these and other questions from a variety of perspectives. \nMr. Borchers>|>UWS>

Conversely, the body can also be a source of embarrassment, dismay, and disgust. Both the pleasure and the disgust the body can evoke are brought together in the concept of the ¿grotesque body,¿ which will be the theme of this writing seminar. Mikhail Bakhtin claimed that exaggeration, hyperbolism, and excessiveness are ¿fundamental attributes of the grotesque style,¿ and that, as a mode of representation, the grotesque comments on and critiques social realities. In this class we will read, discuss, and write about the ¿grotesque body¿ as it is represented across a variety of cultural texts, including poetry, short stories, and television, in order to ask what critical functions those representations serve. What can the spectacle of a ¿grotesque body¿ convey that an ordinary one can¿t? For what reasons and on what occasions is the grotesque appropriate? Is the grotesque ever ¿appropriate¿? We will consider the function of the ¿grotesque body¿ with respect to issues of gender, race, and class, drawing examples from the past, as well as from our own historical moment, as we work together to write three major essays, each developing skills that will be crucial throughout your college careers.\nMs. Van Kley>|>UWS>

More than a distinguishable `sound¿, country music begat a culture in American society that spans from the rural dusty roads of the Southwest to the metropoles of the East coast. Embedded in this music is a rich story of America and all of its complications. Its rich history and cultural shape shifting enabled it to become one of the most recognizable signifiers of Americana. But, what is it about country music that paradoxically stirs so much irritability and conviviality, ire and earnestness? Through this course we will investigate this piece of American culture and attempt to answer that question and others that arise through class discussion and germane readings of text and media.\nMr. Gentry>|>UWS>

Despite the remarkable freedom and successes that have characterized Jewish life in America, scholars have increasingly begun to look at the role of antisemitism in shaping the American Jewish experience. Focusing on two case studies, the Leo Frank trial and the publication of Henry Ford¿s The International Jew, this course will consider the extent and distinctiveness of American antisemitism. What do these episodes reveal about the nature of antisemitic prejudice in the United States? And about American society? What do their responses to antisemitism teach us about American Jews and their place in American society?\nMs. Orenstein\nStaff>|>UWS>

These are all familiar variations of the romanticized figure of the frontiersman, the self-reliant individualist chock-full of grit capable of inhabiting the paradise-savage space between civilization and the wild¿the mythic space of the American Frontier. To what extent has the frontier and the frontiersman shaped the cultural and political trajectory of the nation? In what form(s) do these symbols exist in the present? How have they managed to transcend the specific temporalities in which they were originally forged? These are a few of the questions that this course will grapple with as we attempt to divine the incredible staying-power of American frontier mythology. We begin by examining the genre-forming works of canonical 19th-century authors such as James Fennimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman. We then consider the frontier thematic as it manifests in the American Western and explore the ways in which traditional tropes of the frontier are remapped onto both today¿s and tomorrow¿s national landscapes.\nMr. Moore>|>UWS>

We mob them to protest bad banking; we use them to drive West and find ourselves. As the most public of all locations, they define our ideas of space, community, and travel. And we often feel personal possession over ¿our¿ street corner, intersection, or address. Yet, despite their cultural importance in locating us, in advancing social causes, and in moving us from place to place, many dismiss streets as empty conduits.\n\nAmong other texts, this course will use a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, a theoretical essay by Georg Simmel, and the road movie Little Miss Sunshine to interrogate our own assumptions about the public-private space of streets and about American street-related culture.  Why is it that we use roads to map development, we use streets to make political statements, and we locate ourselves with pavement byways? And what do streets mean to American movements, subcultures, and literature?\nMs. Fash>|>UWS>

Earlier anthropological studies typically treated men and masculinity as normal or \"unmarked\" categories, and while feminist scholars in the 1970s began generating increasing attention to problems of gender, gender studies are often equated with \"women¿s studies.\"\n\nThis course will seek to expose students to a range of cross-cultural meanings and practices of masculinity, including changes and crises in Chinese masculinities, semen transaction rituals in Papua New Guinea, and manifestations of machismo in Mexico as well as other popular perceptions of what it means to be a man in contemporary North America. \nMr. Miller>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  23A>|>The Monster and Me>|>Whether its Frankensteins Monster or Dr. Jekylls counterpart, Mr. Hyde, we are often both fascinated and repelled by these beings. We may even wonder how different we really are from the dysfunctional creatures. Does each of us, in fact, harbor a subconscious monster? Do we even have agency over our actions and ourselves? Focusing on monstrous figures depicted in literature, we will consider the various ways we construct and deconstruct identity. To frame our thinking we will actively participate in the nature versus nurture debate by engaging with critical thinkers from the fields of philosophy and psychology.\nMs. Rourke>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  23B>|>Fantasy Literature>|>Formulaic, predictable, escapist:  all charges leveled against contemporary fantasy\nliterature. These charges have led to the genre’s marginalization by the academy and by critics in general. In recent years, however, fantasy has received more attention  from academics and is increasingly prominent in American pop culture as well, thanks to Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. In this course we will consider ways of classifying members of the genre and discuss works which alter typical formulas. We will also examine the dual heritage of the fantasy protagonist:  part fairy tale, part contemporary novel. Finally, we will look at the political implications of fantasy literature and film to evaluate the charge that fantasy is inherently conservative and atavistic.\n        Our conversations will serve as raw material for the main focus of this UWS:  writing in a college environment. Most courses at Brandeis require writing in some form. This seminar prepares you for your future classes by discussing standards of academic writing, the formulation of effective arguments, and methods of research. You will complete a sequence of assignments which includes three kinds of papers you will encounter throughout your college career. Knowing how to present complex positions and use resources to support them are key abilities no matter which major a student chooses; this seminar helps you to develop these skills.\nMs. Kapelle>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  24A>|>Imagining Australia>|>The continent of Australia is roughly the same size as mainland USA, yet its population is less than that of California. In popular culture, the prevailing image of this sparsely-populated nation is the outback ¿ the ¿bush¿ ¿ yet 87% of Australians live in urban areas. The images of Australia that appeal to tourists ¿ the kangaroo, the koala, Uluru, and the Great Barrier Reef ¿ are associated with a vast unpopulated space. Why does the outback dominate images of Australia? How does Australian culture imagine its urban space and the people who live there? What kind of image does Australia present to the rest of the world? In this Writing Seminar, we examine the images of Australia constructed by various cultural forms: literature, film, art and music. We look at the way images of the nation are constructed and questioned, and how the relationship between Australians and the vast space around them is imagined, sentimentalized, and interrogated.\nMs. Carkeet\nStaff>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  24B>|>Arthurian Adaptions>|>In a twelfth century version of the Arthurian legend, The Brut, Merlin prophesies that King Arthur will provide a “banquet” for minstrels and poets for many ages to come. This prediction has, without a doubt, come true—Arthuriana continues to flourish centuries after the king initially appeared in medieval chronicles and tales. But if Arthur originally functioned as an important figure in discussions of British national identity, how has his image changed over time and what does he mean to us now, here in the U.S.? How have writers adapted his stories to suit different situations and different political and social agendas? In this course we will examine a range of Arthurian adaptations from Victorian era short stories to contemporary films. Our conversations and readings on this topic will serve as raw material for a sequence of assignments which includes three kinds of papers you will encounter throughout your college career:  a close reading of a single text, the reading of a primary text through a theoretical lens, and a researched argument. The course will acquaint you with college-level expectations for writing and equip you with skills which are essential for success at Brandeis.\nMs. Kapelle>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  25A>|>Race, Dance and Videotape>|>From the martial capoeira arts of slavery to dancehall, from jazz to modern dance, from hip-hop to krump, from salsa to mambo, dance has been a way that blacks were defined and have defined themselves as raced, gendered and sexualized beings, carrying the marks of a cultural identity. In this course we will use our screenings of various dance videos, performances and films as the background to discuss issues of race and performance, as we develop the analytical and argumentative skills of sophisticated academic writing. Assignments will range from close reading clichés of blackness in hip-hop and R&B music videos, and exploring the concept of ¿Negro Dance¿ in Josephine Baker or Alvin Ailey, to researching recent dance films such as Dance with Me, Step Up and Stomp the Yard .\nMs. Hamilton>|>UWS>

>UWS>|>  26A>|>Payback: Revenge in American Culture>|>Whether getting even or paying back, revenge is spoken in the idiom of debt and credit. What can this economic register tell us about the value of revenge in American culture? What sort of payment does revenge extract? This course will examine vengeance¿s various forms in the national imaginary and weigh the moral, political, and legal ramifications of retribution. After familiarizing ourselves with classical theories of revenge (Kant, Bacon, Nietzsche), we¿ll turn our attention to contemporary narratives of ¿wild justice.¿ Writing assignments will investigate the historical evolution of revenge and why modern American culture teems with tales of retaliation. The course reading includes works by James Baldwin, Joyce Carol Oates, and one or two films about angry citizens.\nMr. Wiggins>|>UWS>
